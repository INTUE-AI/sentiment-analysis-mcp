# Agent Marketplace

## Agent Marketplace

### Overview

The INTUE Agent Marketplace enables developers to create, deploy, and monetize custom trading agents. This platform provides a standardized framework for agent distribution, evaluation, and compensation.

### For Agent Creators

#### Monetization Models

The marketplace supports multiple revenue models for agent creators:

1. **Performance Fee Structure**
   * Earn 0.05-1.25% on agent-generated alpha
   * Automatic fee calculation and distribution
   * Real-time performance tracking
2. **Subscription Licensing**
   * Implement tiered access to agent capabilities
   * Monthly or annual subscription options
   * Free/premium feature differentiation
3. **Usage-based Compensation**
   * Monetize per-execution or compute-time metrics
   * Volume discounts for high-usage customers
   * Metered billing for specialized capabilities
4. **Hybrid Tokenized Models**
   * Stake on agent performance with proportional returns
   * Token-based governance of agent parameters
   * Community-driven development incentives

#### Submission Process

To submit an agent to the marketplace:

1. **Development**: Create your agent using the INTUE SDK
2. **Testing**: Validate functionality through backtesting and simulation
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation and examples
4. **Submission**: Submit for review through the Marketplace Portal
5. **Review**: Pass the technical and security review process
6. **Publishing**: Deploy to the marketplace with your chosen monetization model
7. **Updates**: Maintain and update your agent as needed\


#### Technical Requirements

All marketplace agents must meet these requirements:\
\
// Required interfaces\
interface MarketplaceAgent {\
// Core functionality\
initialize(config: AgentConfig): Promise;\
process(data: MarketData): Promise;\
getMetadata(): AgentMetadata;\
// Technical requirements continued\
interface MarketplaceAgent {\
// Documentation\
getDocumentation(): AgentDocumentation;

// Performance metrics\
getPerformanceMetrics(): PerformanceMetrics;

// Security compliance\
validateSecurity(): SecurityValidation;

// Resource requirements\
getResourceRequirements(): ResourceRequirements;\
}

// All agents must implement proper error handling\
try {\
// Agent processing\
} catch (error) {\
// Log and handle error appropriately\
logger.error(Processing error: ${error.message}, {\
stack: error.stack,\
context: currentContext\
});

// Implement graceful degradation\
return fallbackResponse();\
}\
\


#### Quality Standards

Marketplace agents are evaluated based on:

1. **Signal Quality**: Accuracy and precision of generated signals
2. **Performance Consistency**: Stability across market conditions
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Computational and memory requirements
4. **Documentation Quality**: Clarity and completeness of documentation
5. **Code Quality**: Clean, well-structured, and maintainable code
6. **Security**: Robustness against manipulation and data leakage
7. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases and failures

   * Signal accuracy statistics
2. **Filtering and Sorting**
   * By asset class or ecosystem focus
   * By strategy type (momentum, arbitrage, sentiment, etc.)
   * By performance criteria
   * By creator reputation and track record
   * By popularity and user ratings
3. **Detailed Agent Profiles**
   * Strategy explanation and methodology
   * Supported exchanges and assets
   * Configuration options and parameters

       #### Integration Code

       ```javascript
       // Integrate a marketplace agent into your trading system
       import { MarketplaceSDK } from '@intue/marketplace';
       import { BinanceAdapter } from '@intue/exchange-adapters';

       async function deployMarketplaceAgent() {
         // Initialize marketplace SDK
         const marketplace = new MarketplaceSDK({
           apiKey: process.env.INTUE_API_KEY
         });
         
         // Find and retrieve agent
         const availableAgents = await marketplace.searchAgents({
           category: 'momentum',
           minPerformance: {
             sharpeRatio: 1.5,
             maxDrawdown: -0.25  // 25% max drawdown
           },
           ecosystem: 'defi'
         });
         
         // Select and deploy agent
         const selectedAgent = availableAgents[0];
         const deployedAgent = await marketplace.deployAgent({
           agentId: selectedAgent.id,
           version: 'latest',

         deployedAgent.onSignal(async (signal) => {
           console.log('Received signal:', signal);
           
           // Execute trade based on signal
           if (signal.confidence > 0.8) {
             const tradeResult = await deployedAgent.executeTrade(signal);
             console.log('Trade executed:', tradeResult);
