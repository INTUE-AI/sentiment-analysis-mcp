## INTUE Meta Agent

### Overview

The INTUE Meta Agent specializes in forecasting market shifts through narrative analysis and causal relationship identification. This agent processes market, social, and on-chain data to detect emerging narratives before they manifest in price action.

```javascript
const metaAgent = new MetaAgent({
  forecastHorizon: '14d',  // Forecasting window
  narrativeThreshold: 0.65,  // Minimum confidence for narrative identification
  causationAnalysis: true,  // Enable causal relationship modeling
  temporalResolution: '4h'  // Analysis granularity
});
```

### Narrative Analysis Methodology

The Meta Agent implements a sophisticated approach to narrative detection and forecasting:

1. **Semantic Cluster Identification**: Groups related discussions and on-chain activities
2. **Causal Graph Construction**: Maps relationships between events, narratives, and price movements
3. **Narrative Amplification Tracking**: Measures the growth and adoption of specific narratives
4. **Counter-Narrative Analysis**: Identifies potential challenges to dominant market stories

Narratives undergo rigorous validation through:

* Historical pattern matching
* Sentiment corroboration
* Volume and engagement analysis
* Institutional positioning assessment

### Key Functions

#### analyzeNarrativeFormation()

```javascript
const narratives = await metaAgent.analyzeNarrativeFormation({
  ecosystems: ['ai', 'layer1', 'gaming'],
  minimumStrength: 0.6,
  emergingOnly: true,
  includeCounterNarratives: true
});
```

Identifies forming narratives across specified ecosystems, returning detailed analysis of strength, potential impact, and estimated timeframes.

#### forecast()

```javascript
const forecast = await metaAgent.forecast({
  asset: 'ETH',
  horizon: '7d',
  confidenceInterval: 0.9,
  factors: ['narrative', 'technical', 'onchain', 'macro']
});
```

Generates probabilistic forecasts for specified assets based on narrative analysis and supporting factors.

### Integration Capabilities

The Meta Agent integrates with other INTUE agents to enhance their effectiveness:

* **Momentum Agent Enhancement**: Provides narrative context for momentum signals
* **Arbitrage Agent Support**: Identifies narrative-driven correlation breakdowns
* **Risk Management**: Assesses narrative-based risk factors for position sizing

```javascript
// Enhance momentum analysis with narrative context
const enhancedSignals = await metaAgent.enhanceMomentumSignals({
  signals: momentumSignals,
  narrativeAlignment: true,
  counterNarrativeRisk: true
});
```

### Development Status

The Meta Agent is currently in final integration phase with an anticipated release in Q3 2025. Current performance metrics from beta testing:

* Narrative identification accuracy: 76%
* Forecast directional accuracy: 68% (7-day horizon)
* Average lead time: 2.3 days before mainstream recognition
* Projected alpha generation: +11.3% against benchmark
