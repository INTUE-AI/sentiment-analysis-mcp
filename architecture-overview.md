# Architecture Overview

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

INTUE's architecture consists of five primary components:

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects and normalizes market data from exchanges, on-chain sources, and social metrics
2. **Protocol Layer**: Contains the MCPs that process and contextualize data
3. **Agent Layer**: Houses autonomous agents that leverage protocols for analysis and decision-making
4. **Execution Layer**: Handles order execution and position management via exchange adapters
5. **Interface Layer**: Provides APIs, dashboards, and monitoring tools

### Data Flow

1. **Raw data** streams in from exchanges, on-chain sources, and social platforms
2. The **Data Ingestion Layer** normalizes and organizes this data into standardized formats
3. **Protocol Processing** applies specialized MCPs to extract meaningful patterns and relationships
4. **Agent Analysis** evaluates protocol outputs to generate actionable signals
5. The **Execution Framework** translates signals into orders via exchange adapters
6. Performance feedback is continuously evaluated to optimize agent behavior

### Component Interaction

Agents interact with protocols through a standardized API, allowing them to:

* Request specific data processing
* Subscribe to continuous updates
* Compose multiple protocol outputs
* Provide feedback for protocol optimization

This modular design enables independent development and evolution of each component while maintaining system cohesion.
