# Advanced Topics - Swarm Intelligence

## Swarm Intelligence

### Overview

INTUE's swarm intelligence framework enables multiple specialized agents to collaborate, coordinate, and reach consensus through distributed decision-making. This multi-agent architecture harnesses collective intelligence to outperform individual agent capabilities.

### Swarm Architecture

The swarm architecture consists of:

1. **Specialized Agents**: Autonomous units with distinct analytical focuses
2. **Coordination Layer**: Communication and consensus protocols
3. **Objective Function**: Common optimization goals
4. **Collective Memory**: Shared knowledge and historical learning
5. **Meta-coordination**: Agents that oversee the swarm's operation

```javascript
// Base swarm configuration
const swarmConfig = {
  name: 'Market Analysis Swarm',
  objective: 'maximum_risk_adjusted_return',
  communicationProtocol: 'message_passing',
  consensusMechanism: 'weighted_voting',
  adaptiveLearning: true
};

// Initialize swarm with member agents
const marketSwarm = new AgentSwarm(swarmConfig);

// Add specialized agents to swarm
marketSwarm.addAgent(momentumAgent, { weight: 0.25 });
marketSwarm.addAgent(sentimentAgent, { weight: 0.20 });
marketSwarm.addAgent(correlationAgent, { weight: 0.20 });
marketSwarm.addAgent(volatilityAgent, { weight: 0.15 });
marketSwarm.addAgent(fundamentalsAgent, { weight: 0.20 });

// Initialize swarm coordination
await marketSwarm.initialize();
```
