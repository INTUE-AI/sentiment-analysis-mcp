# INTUE m0

## INTUE m0 Agent

### Overview

The INTUE m0 Agent specializes in early detection of directional market movements across cryptocurrency ecosystems. By analyzing leading indicators and sentiment shifts, this agent identifies momentum patterns before they become apparent in price action.

```javascript
const momentumAgent = new MomentumAgent({
  sensitivity: 'medium',  // Options: low, medium, high
  timeframes: ['1h', '4h', '1d'],
  minimumConfidence: 0.75,
  signalPersistence: 72  // Hours
});
```

### Signal Detection Methodology

The Momentum Agent utilizes a multi-layered approach to signal detection:

1. **Temporal Pattern Analysis**: Identifies acceleration in price, volume, and sentiment metrics
2. **Cross-Ecosystem Leading Indicators**: Detects momentum transfer between related ecosystems
3. **Sentiment Divergence**: Recognizes disparities between market sentiment and price action
4. **Narrative Formation**: Tracks emerging narratives across social and on-chain metrics

Each signal undergoes confidence scoring based on:

* Historical accuracy under similar conditions
* Confirmation across multiple timeframes
* Correlation with related indicators
* Sentiment alignment

### Key Functions

#### detectEmerging()

```javascript
const signals = await momentumAgent.detectEmerging({
  ecosystems: ['ai-agents', 'defi', 'gaming'],
  timeframe: '7d',
  minimumConfidence: 0.7
});
```

Returns emerging momentum signals across specified ecosystems with confidence scores and projected timeframes.

#### analyzeEcosystemMomentum()

```javascript
const analysis = await momentumAgent.analyzeEcosystemMomentum({
  ecosystem: 'defi',
  components: true,  // Break down by ecosystem components
  metrics: ['price', 'volume', 'social', 'development']
});
```

Provides detailed momentum analysis for a specific ecosystem, including component-level breakdowns and multi-metric evaluation.

### Trading Integration

When initialized with trading capabilities, the Momentum Agent can:

* Execute trades based on detected signals
* Implement dynamic position sizing based on confidence scores
* Set appropriate stop-loss and take-profit levels
* Manage multiple positions across different assets and exchanges

```javascript
// Initialize trading capabilities
momentumAgent.initializeTrading({
  exchange: binanceAdapter,
  riskManagement: {
    maxRiskPerTrade: 0.02,  // 2% per trade
    stopLossPercent: 0.05,  // 5% stop loss
    takeProfitPercent: 0.1   // 10% take profit
  },
  quoteAsset: 'USDT'
});

// Execute trades based on momentum signals
const trades = await momentumAgent.executeTrades({
  ecosystems: ['ai-agents', 'defi'],
  timeframe: '7d',
  confidenceThreshold: 0.75
});
```

### Performance Metrics

The Momentum Agent maintains comprehensive performance tracking:

* Signal accuracy rate (historically 87% on high-confidence signals)
* Average return per signal (23.4% for Q1 2025)
* False positive rate (3.1%)
* Average detection lead time (9.2 hours before conventional indicators)
