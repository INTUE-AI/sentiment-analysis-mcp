# Analysis MCPs

Overview

Analysis Model Context Protocols (MCPs) apply advanced statistical and mathematical methods to market data, uncovering complex patterns and relationships beyond simple metrics and correlations.


Available Analysis Protocols

Non-Linear Correlation MCP
Implements advanced statistical methods for detecting complex, non-linear relationships:

```
const nonLinearMCP = new NonLinearCorrelationMCP({
  assets: ['BTC', 'ETH', 'SOL', 'AVAX'],
  methods: ['spearman', 'kendall-tau', 'mutual-information'],
  significance: 0.95,
  windowSize: '30d'
});

const nonLinearRelationships = await nonLinearMCP.process();
// Returns: Non-linear relationship metrics
```

Key capabilities:
* Rank correlation analysis
* Mutual information calculation
* Non-parametric relationship detection
* Power law relationship identification

Multi-Factor Correlation MCP
Combines multiple metrics into composite factors for higher-level analysis:

```
const multiFactorMCP = new MultiFactorCorrelationMCP({
  factors: [
    {
      name: 'momentum',
      metrics: ['price-change', 'volume-change', 'social-sentiment']
    },
    {
      name: 'fundamentals',
      metrics: ['active-addresses', 'transaction-value', 'fees']
    },
    {
      name: 'risk',
      metrics: ['volatility', 'liquidity', 'drawdown']
    }
  ],
  normalization: 'z-score',
  dimensionReduction: 'pca'
});

const factorAnalysis = await multiFactorMCP.process();
// Returns: Factor analysis with principal components
```
Key capabilities:

* Composite factor construction
* Principal component analysis
* Factor significance testing
* Cross-factor correlation analysis

Pattern Recognition MCP
Identifies recurring market patterns and historical precedents:
```
const patternMCP = new PatternRecognitionMCP({
  patterns: ['head-and-shoulders', 'double-bottom', 'bull-flag', 'wyckoff-accumulation'],
  timeframes: ['1h', '4h', '1d'],
  minimumConfidence: 0.75,
  includeHiddenPatterns: true
});

const detectedPatterns = await patternMCP.process();
// Returns: Identified patterns with confidence metrics
```

Key capabilities:

* Technical pattern recognition
* Pattern completion projection
* Historical success rate analysis
* Multi-timeframe confirmation
* Causality Analysis MCP
* Goes beyond correlation to analyze potential causal relationships:

```
const causalityMCP = new CausalityAnalysisMCP({
  variables: ['btc-price', 'eth-price', 'defi-tvl', 'market-sentiment'],
  method: 'granger',
  maxLag: 10,
  significance: 0.95
});

const causalRelationships = await causalityMCP.process();
// Returns: Causal relationship graph with confidence metrics
```

Key capabilities:
* Granger causality testing
* Causal graph construction
* Driver/follower classification
* Intervention analysis

 
Additional Analysis MCPs

* Time Series Forecasting MCP: Implements predictive models for time series data
* Regime Change Detection MCP: Identifies market phase transitions
* Attribution Analysis MCP: Performs factor performance breakdown
* Risk Decomposition MCP: Analyzes multiple sources of market risk
* Structural Break Detection MCP: Identifies fundamental changes in market behavior

Integration Example
```
// Advanced analytical pipeline
const advancedAnalysisMCP = new AnalysisPipelineMCP({
  stages: [
    new AnomalyDetectionMCP({ /* config */ }),
    new NonLinearCorrelationMCP({ /* config */ }),
    new CausalityAnalysisMCP({ /* config */ })
  ],
  feedbackLoops: true,
  persistIntermediateResults: true
});

const analysisResults = await advancedAnalysisMCP.process();
// Returns: Multi-stage analytical results
```

This pipeline approach enables sophisticated analytical workflows through the sequential application of specialized analysis protocols.
