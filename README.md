## INTUE Documentation

### Welcome to INTUE

INTUE is the intelligence layer for autonomous trading agents, a comprehensive framework designed for quantitative analysis of cryptocurrency markets using advanced AI protocols and agent-based architecture.

Our platform enables sophisticated signal detection, cross-ecosystem correlation analysis, and autonomous trade execution with unprecedented precision. By leveraging specialized Model Context Protocols (MCPs), INTUE bridges the gap between raw market data and actionable trading intelligence.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the INTUE ecosystem, from high-level concepts to detailed technical specifications for developers, traders, and researchers looking to harness the power of autonomous trading intelligence.

Whether you're implementing an existing agent, developing custom MCPs, or creating entirely new agents for the marketplace, this documentation will serve as your definitive resource for working with the INTUE platform.\

Core Concepts

#### Agent Architecture

INTUE agents are autonomous, specialized intelligence modules designed to perform specific market analysis functions. Each agent implements a modular architecture consisting of:

* **Signal Generators**: Specialized algorithms for pattern detection across market data
* **Decision Engine**: Processing pipeline for signal evaluation and action determination
* **Execution Framework**: Interface layer for trade execution and position management
* **Performance Analytics**: Self-evaluation and optimization mechanisms

Agents communicate via standardized protocols, enabling composition of complex strategies from simpler building blocks. This modular design allows for continuous improvement and customization without disrupting the overall system.

#### Model Context Protocols (MCPs)

MCPs form the foundation of INTUE's intelligence capabilities. These specialized processing modules transform raw market data into contextually relevant signals through:

* **Category Classification**: Ecosystem and token categorization with specialized metrics
* **Metric Processing**: Standardized calculation of key performance indicators
* **Correlation Detection**: Identification of relationships between disparate data points
* **Advanced Analysis**: Statistical processing using sophisticated mathematical models

MCPs are composable, allowing agents to leverage multiple protocols simultaneously for enhanced signal detection and pattern recognition.

#### Trading Execution Framework

The execution layer provides standardized interfaces to multiple exchanges through adapter modules that handle:

* **Order Management**: Precise execution with minimal slippage
* **Position Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of active positions
* **Risk Management**: Automated stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing
* **Exchange-Specific Optimizations**: Adapter-level specialization for each venue

This framework ensures consistent behavior across different trading venues while optimizing for the unique characteristics of each exchange.
